	According to recent Citi Bike Data from October 2020 through January 2021, we can see the latest trends of rider data. I chose to focus on age, gender, number of riders, trip distance, duration, user types and most popular starting and ending stations. We can see with the top ten most popular starting stations on the map that distance is definitely a factor. Surprisingly there seems to be a moderate correlation to longer trips with the more popular stations. The same is shown in the ten most popular ending stations.
	According to average age and user type, we can see that subscribers tend to be a little bit older on average around 40 compared to customers who tend to be around 30. There is no huge difference between men and women in this category. Also as expected younger people that tend to be between 30 and 40 take the longest bike trips compared to those above 60 who take much shorter trips.
